# Library-JS-Project
Created Library Project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have so far used Fetch API from JS and Open Library API. I am currently trying to implement a reviews database that uses MongoDB to store the reviews and Express JS and CORS for server-side. This project was based on freeCodeCamp's resource.
